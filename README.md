# dataset
Objective: extract bounding box information for the mannequin through aligmnent of LIDAR and Optitrack 

Quickstart:
  1. Add to directory the following:
     
    - "take_2" folder
     
    - human_description.csv
    
    - main.py

  
  2. run code

For InludeBox branch: Box bounding box is now writen to file, but bounding box is wrong.
Also it only works on take 4 (because it has both human and box)
